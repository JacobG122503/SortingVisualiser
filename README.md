<h1>Sorting Visualiser 1.00</h1>

<h2>General Info</h2>

This program is a sorting visualiser. It generates a random graph of lines with varying lengths and shows an animation of them being sorted. 
The program has a bunch of different sorting algorithms to choose from. It also has a leaderboard so you can see what was the fastest sort, however, 
there is a delay implemented in the sorting so you can actually see the sorting animation. You have the option to change this delay in the program. The data for the graphs are actually generated using your terminal size, so the bigger your terminal, 
the bigger the set of data. Just a tip, if you're going to sort a massive set of data, probably set the delay to be low because some of these algorithms can be very inefficient on large sets and will take a long, long time. 

<h2>Sorting Algorithms</h2>

The program implements the following algorithms:

1. Quicksort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Bubble Sort
4. Selection Sort
5. Dual Pivot Quicksort
6. Merge Sort
7. Bingo Sort
8. Pancake Sort
9. Comb Sort
10. Gnome/Stupid sort

<h2>Running the Program</h2>
