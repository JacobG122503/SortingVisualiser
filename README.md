<h1>Sorting Visualiser 1.00</h1>

<h2>General Info</h2>

This program is a sorting visualiser. It generates a random graph of lines with varying lengths and shows an animation of them being sorted. 
The program has a bunch of different sorting algorithms to choose from. It also has a leaderboard so you can see what was the fastest sort, however, 
there is a delay implemented in the sorting so you can actually see the sorting animation. You can modify this delay by changing the constant
in the Algorithms.cpp file if you so choose. The data on for the graphs are actually generated using your terminal size, so the bigger your terminal, 
the bigger the set of data. Keep in mind, the delay also increases with the size of the terminal, this is to prevent the screen from flashing a lot
during the animation. 

<h2>Running the Program</h2>
